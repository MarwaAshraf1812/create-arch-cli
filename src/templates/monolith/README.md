# Monolith Architecture

## Overview

This template creates a **monolithic application** - a single deployable unit that contains all the functionality of your application in one codebase.

## Architecture Characteristics

### ✅ Advantages
- **Simple Development**: All code in one place, easy to understand and navigate
- **Easy Testing**: Integration testing is straightforward
- **Simple Deployment**: One application to deploy and manage
- **Performance**: No network latency between components
- **ACID Transactions**: Easy to maintain data consistency
- **Debugging**: Easier to trace requests through the system

### ⚠️ Considerations
- **Scaling**: Entire application must be scaled as a unit
- **Technology Lock-in**: Difficult to adopt new technologies incrementally
- **Team Coordination**: Multiple teams working on same codebase can create conflicts
- **Deployment Risk**: Single point of failure for deployments

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── core/
│   ├── db.ts          # Database connection and configuration
│   └── server.ts      # Express server setup and middleware
├── modules/
│   └── auth/
│       ├── auth.controller.ts  # Authentication HTTP handlers
│       ├── auth.route.ts       # Authentication routes
│       └── auth.service.ts     # Authentication business logic
└── index.ts           # Application entry point
```

## Architecture Pattern

This monolith follows a **modular monolith** pattern:

- **Modules**: Organized by business domain (auth, users, orders, etc.)
- **Layered Architecture**: Controller → Service → Data Access
- **Shared Core**: Common utilities, database, and server configuration

## When to Use Monolith

### Perfect For:
- **New Projects**: Start simple, refactor later if needed
- **Small to Medium Teams**: 2-10 developers
- **Simple Business Logic**: Well-defined, stable requirements
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick to get started and iterate
- **Cost-Sensitive Projects**: Lower operational complexity

### Consider Alternatives When:
- Team size > 10-15 developers
- Different parts need different scaling patterns
- Multiple technology stacks are beneficial
- Deployment independence is crucial

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Run Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Add New Modules**:
   - Create new folder in `src/modules/`
   - Follow the same pattern: controller, route, service
   - Register routes in `src/index.ts`

## Migration Path

As your application grows, you can:

1. **Extract Services**: Move complex logic to separate services
2. **Database Separation**: Split data by domain boundaries
3. **API Gateway**: Add a gateway layer for future microservices
4. **Microservices**: Extract modules to independent services

## Best Practices

- Keep modules loosely coupled
- Use dependency injection
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document API endpoints
- Use consistent error handling
