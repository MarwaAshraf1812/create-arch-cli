# Microservices Architecture

## Overview

This template creates a **microservices-based application** - a collection of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.

## Architecture Characteristics

### ✅ Advantages
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale services based on individual demand
- **Technology Diversity**: Use different tech stacks per service
- **Team Independence**: Teams can work and deploy independently
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't crash the entire system
- **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller codebases are easier to understand
- **Continuous Deployment**: Deploy services independently

### ⚠️ Considerations
- **Distributed Complexity**: Network calls, latency, and failure handling
- **Data Consistency**: Managing transactions across services
- **Operational Overhead**: More services to monitor and maintain
- **Development Complexity**: Service discovery, configuration management
- **Testing Challenges**: Integration testing across services

## Project Structure

```
auth/                  # Authentication Service
├── src/
│   └── index.ts      # Auth service implementation
├── package.json      # Auth service dependencies
└── Dockerfile        # Auth service containerization

user/                  # User Management Service  
├── src/
│   └── index.ts      # User service implementation
├── package.json      # User service dependencies
└── Dockerfile        # User service containerization

```

## Architecture Patterns

### Service Communication
- **Synchronous**: HTTP/REST APIs for request-response
- **Asynchronous**: Message queues for event-driven communication
- **Service Discovery**: Registry pattern for finding services

### Data Management
- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data
- **Event Sourcing**: Store events, not just current state
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for clients
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Distributed Tracing**: Track requests across services
- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs from all services

## When to Use Microservices

### Perfect For:
- **Large Teams**: 15+ developers across multiple teams
- **Complex Domains**: Clear business boundaries exist
- **Scale Requirements**: Different scaling needs per component
- **Technology Diversity**: Benefits from different tech stacks
- **High Availability**: Need independent failure isolation

### Consider Alternatives When:
- Small team (< 10 developers)
- Simple, well-defined problem domain
- Limited operational expertise
- Strong consistency requirements
- Rapid prototyping phase

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ 
- Basic understanding of distributed systems

### 1. Start All Services
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 2. Individual Service Development
```bash
# Auth Service
cd auth/
npm install
npm run dev

# User Service  
cd user/
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Service Endpoints
- **Auth Service**: `http://localhost:3001`
- **User Service**: `http://localhost:3002`

## Adding New Services

1. **Create Service Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir order-service
   cd order-service
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Add to Docker Compose**:
   ```yaml
   order-service:
     build: ./order-service
     ports:
       - "3003:3000"
     environment:
       - NODE_ENV=development
   ```

3. **Implement Service**:
   - Follow same structure as existing services
   - Define clear API contracts
   - Implement health checks
   - Add monitoring and logging

## Best Practices

### Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: One business capability per service
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between services
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality should be together
- **Data Ownership**: Each service owns its data

### Implementation
- **API Versioning**: Plan for backward compatibility
- **Idempotency**: Design operations to be repeatable
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle service failures elegantly
- **Health Checks**: Implement liveness and readiness probes

### Operations
- **Monitoring**: Track metrics, logs, and traces
- **Security**: Implement service-to-service authentication
- **Configuration**: Externalize configuration
- **Deployment**: Use container orchestration (Kubernetes)

## Common Patterns

### Data Consistency
```typescript
// Saga Pattern Example
class OrderSaga {
  async processOrder(order: Order) {
    try {
      await this.reserveInventory(order);
      await this.processPayment(order);
      await this.confirmOrder(order);
    } catch (error) {
      await this.compensate(order, error);
    }
  }
}
```

### Circuit Breaker
```typescript
class UserServiceClient {
  private circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker(this.callUserService, {
    timeout: 3000,
    errorThreshold: 50,
    resetTimeout: 30000
  });

  async getUser(id: string) {
    return this.circuitBreaker.fire(id);
  }
}
```

## Migration Strategies

### From Monolith
1. **Strangler Fig**: Gradually replace monolith components
2. **Database Decomposition**: Split shared databases
3. **Extract Services**: Start with least coupled components
4. **API Gateway**: Add routing layer for smooth transition

### Scaling Approach
1. Start with 2-3 services
2. Establish operational practices
3. Add services based on team structure
4. Optimize based on real usage patterns
